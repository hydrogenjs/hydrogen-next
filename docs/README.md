# Hydrogen Next Design Document

The goal of this document is to be a mind dump of what I want the next iteration of Hydrogen to be. I developed [Hydrogen](https://github.com/hydrogenjs/hydrogen), the initial first close to 5 years now and that was a long time ago by the JavaScript ecosystem time frame. There is a new framework that is being released and new ways of doing things constantly so Hydrogen is probably far out of the loop in relation to the initial intentions behind the project which was to be the lightest static-site generator out there, which provides just enough utility to allow a developer to make use of it in there workflows for the most simplest of tasks.

I know that there was a team in Denmark that was using it for their style guide but that was years ago, they might have migrated to something else but it is always worth trying to sink my teeth into trying to achieve my goals now that I have gained more experience and knowledge.
